# IAM basics

## IAM

IAM stands for Identity and Access Management. We assume students know the following concepts on a high-level:

* Users
* Groups
* Policies&#x20;
* Roles

The IAM FAQ answers most of your questions: [https://aws.amazon.com/iam/faqs/](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/faqs/)

Also take a look at the documentation: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html)

## What should I know?&#x20;

* Difference between credentials for console vs programmatic access
* How to add permissions to a user
* What are roles used for.
