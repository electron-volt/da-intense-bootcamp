# üçí Course overview

## Agenda for the week

We will cover the following topics over the next five days:

1. Serverless&#x20;
2. Compute services, networking, load balancing&#x20;
3. Infrastructure as Code, object storage, databases
4. Containers, Developer tools
5. Application integration, security.

## What to expect

We will go through most of the material required to pass the AWS Developer Associate course. The focus is on hands-on labs rather than theory.&#x20;

### Goal of this course&#x20;

Going over this material will prepare you to either work with AWS services related to developing, securing and deploying workloads in AWS and/or pass the AWS Certified Developer Associate exam.

The material covers most - but by no means all - of what you need to pass the exam, but you will be in a much better position to start learning more theory once you've gotten some hands-on experience with the services first.&#x20;

### What kind of background am I expected to have?&#x20;

We assume familiarity with some basic cloud computing concepts such as

* Elasticity, high availability, scalability, fault-tolerance.

We also assume students have some high-level understanding of the following AWS concepts:

* Global infrastructure of AWS: regions, availability zones
* The basics of IAM: users, groups, policies, roles.

Next up is a quick primer on these AWS concepts. You can skip it if you already know the concepts mentioned above.&#x20;
