# Database services

## DynamoDB

This guy we have encountered already. Serverless, schemaless NoSQL database.

## Aurora

Amazon Aurora (Aurora) is a fully managed relational database engine that's compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL. Technically Aurora is is part of the managed database service Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS).&#x20;

Aurora doesn't feature in the Developer Associate exam at the moment, so we will not discuss it further.&#x20;

## RDS

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS Cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks.&#x20;

Amazon RDS currently supports the following database engines:

* MySQL
* MariaDB
* PostgreSQL
* Oracle
* Microsoft SQL Server.

Next we will take a deep dive into RDS.
