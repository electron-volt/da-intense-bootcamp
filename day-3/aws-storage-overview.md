# AWS Storage overview

## EBS

Elastic Block Storage: the only storage where you can install an OS. This is used by EC2 instances as a boot volume and additional volumes.&#x20;

## S3

Simple Storage Service: object storage. The Swiss army knife of cloud storage.

## EFS

Elastic File System. We won't go into EFS in any detail, but just so you know what it is: an elastic file system. EFS works with Linux instances. For Windows instances, there is FSx for Windows. For HPC (high performance computing) there is FSx for Lustre.&#x20;
