# ðŸ¥¶ Elastic Beanstalk

We will quickly skim over Elastic Beanstalk. The word on the street is that it's not really used very much anymore (can't cite my source) and is being replaced by things like AWS Amplify and so on. (You will find content about Amplify in the Bonus section.)

Elastic Beanstalk does however still feature on the Developer associate exam, so we will include it in the course.&#x20;

But what about acronyms? We can't use ELB or EBS, so let's call Elastic Beanstalk.. Elbe. It's AWS man, you gotta have an acronym.&#x20;

## What _is_ Elastic Beanstalk?&#x20;

You could almost think of it as a GUI for CloudFormation.&#x20;

"With Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without having to learn about the infrastructure that runs those applications. You simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring."

Under the hood Elbe uses Cloudformation to launch the resources.&#x20;

Do read up on it if you are going to take the certification exam.&#x20;
