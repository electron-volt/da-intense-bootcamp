# Day 3

## Schedule

09:00-12:30 CloudFormation, S3

12:30-13:30 Lunch&#x20;

13:30-16:00 RDS, Elastic Beanstalk



Today will be a little bit easier on purpose. If there was something that we didn't have time to go over on day 2 or we want to go over again, we should find time for it on day 3.

There are also bonus labs at the end that we can do.
