# Security of VPC's

## Security groups&#x20;

A security group is an instance-level virtual firewall. Some features of security groups:

* SG's have allow rules, but not deny rules.
* An SG has separate rules for inbound and outbound traffic.
* Security group rules enable you to filter traffic based on protocols and port numbers.
* Security groups are **stateful** â€” if you send a request from your instance, the response traffic for that request is allowed to flow in regardless of inbound security group rules. Responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to flow out, regardless of outbound rules.

## NACL

A _network access control list (ACL)_ or NACL is a subnet-level virtual firewall. Some features of NACL's:

* A network ACL has separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can either allow or deny traffic.
* Network ACLs are **stateless**, which means that responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to the rules for outbound traffic (and vice versa).
* A network ACL contains a numbered list of rules. We evaluate the rules in order, starting with the lowest numbered rule, to determine whether traffic is allowed in or out of any subnet associated with the network ACL.
