# üßÅ End of day 2

## Clean up&#x20;

We did clean up after our labs but it doesn't hurt to check before you go home.&#x20;

The only really expensive resource is the load balancer, so make sure you don't have any up and running.&#x20;

## What have we learned today

* to build our own VPC's
* to launch EC2 instances on demand or automatically with ASG's
* how to route requests to different instances with ALB
* how to set up a self-healing and highly available web server with ALB+ASG.
