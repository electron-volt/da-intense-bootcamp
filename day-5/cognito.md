# Cognito

## Amazon Cognito

Amazon Cognito offers user pools and identity pools.&#x20;

* User pools are user directories that provide **sign-up and sign-in** options for your app users.&#x20;
* Identity pools provide **AWS credentials** to grant your users access to other AWS services.

You can use identity pools and user pools separately or together.

### User pools

A Cognito user pool is a user directory in AWS. Users can sign in directly with a user name and password, or through a third party such as Facebook, Amazon, Google or Apple.

### Identity pools

With an identity pool, your users can obtain temporary AWS credentials to access AWS services, such as Amazon S3 and DynamoDB. Identity pools support anonymous guest users, as well as federation through third-party IdPs (Identity providers).

### Next step

We are going to be using Cognito in the last lab of the day - of the whole week!&#x20;
