# Grand finale

That's it! After you pushed the changes to config.js, it will take a while for the website to be updated. It's also a good idea to empty the browser cache or open the WildRydes site in a new incognito window.&#x20;

Sign in to the web app&#x20;

Click anywhere on the map&#x20;

Then click Request unicorn (upper right corner)

Watch as your unicorn flies to come get you!&#x20;
