# Step Functions

Step Functions is a serverless orchestration service that lets you combine AWS Lambda functions and other AWS services to build business-critical applications. Through Step Functions' graphical console, you see your applicationâ€™s workflow as a series of event-driven steps.

Step Functions is based on state machines and tasks.&#x20;

* A state machine is a **workflow**.&#x20;
* A task is a state in a workflow that represents a single unit of work that another AWS service performs.&#x20;
* Each step in a workflow is a state.
