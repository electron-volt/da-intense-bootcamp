# Day 1

## Schedule

* 09:00-09:30 Set-up
* 09:30-11:30 Lambda
* 11:30-12:30 Lunch
* 12:30-16:00 DynamoDB, API Gateway

### Setting things up&#x20;

We'll get you set up with the following tools:

* AWS account and credentials
* AWS CLI&#x20;

Then we will take a look at the following three services:

### Lambda

AWS's serverless compute service: run code in response to events without managing servers.&#x20;

### DynamoDB

Schemaless NoSQL database with millisecond latency and push-button scalability.&#x20;

### API Gateway&#x20;

Build and deploy API's.&#x20;

### Last lab of the day: Serverless CRUD

We will put what we have learned to good use and build a simple CRUD operation API using API Gateway, DynamoDB and AWS Lambda.&#x20;
