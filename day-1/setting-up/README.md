# Setting up

We will get started by setting up an AWS account and then installing the AWS command line interface.

#### ðŸŽ¯ A word about the root user

When you create an AWS account, you will be asked for an email address: this email is the username of the **root** user. This user has administrator access to all of the accounts' resources, so it is extremely powerful.&#x20;

Best practice is to immediately do the following:

* set a sufficiently complex password for the root user
* set up MFA for the root user&#x20;
* create a new user and give the user administrator rights
* login as the newly created administrator user instead

We will walk through all of these steps in the next lab.
