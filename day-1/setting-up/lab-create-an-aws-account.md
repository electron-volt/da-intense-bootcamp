# LAB: Create an AWS account

## Create your AWS account

Go to [https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start)

The steps that follow are simple, no more difficult than signing up for Netflix really.

* [ ] Choose an email address for your root user username
* [ ] Choose a complex password (longer is better)&#x20;
* [ ] Choose an alias for your account, e.g. \<your name>-study-2022. This can be changed later.&#x20;
* [ ] Add your credit card information&#x20;
* [ ] Complete the sign-up process.

## Secure your root user&#x20;

While logged in as the root user, navigate to the IAM service. The easiest way is to search for IAM in the search box at the upper left hand corner:\
![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (386).png>)

You will need an authenticator application like Google Authenticator on your phone.

* [ ] Navigate to IAM and select Users from the panel on the left
* [ ] Click on the root user
* [ ] Choose the tab "security credentials"&#x20;
* [ ] From there, find "Assigned MFA device" and press "Manage"
* [ ] Follow the instructions on the screen.

## Create a budget for your account

It is a very smart idea to create a budget. This will help you monitor costs and receive alerts if some resource in your account is generating large expenses.&#x20;

Note: by default only the root user has access to billing information, so please complete this step while logged in as root.&#x20;

* [ ] Navigate to AWS Budgets&#x20;
* [ ] Press "Create budget"
* [ ] For budget type select "Cost budget"

Example settings are: monthly period, recurring budget, start month: current month, fixed. Enter any amount you like: 5 EUR is a good first guess.&#x20;

* [ ] Choose a name for your budget and hit "Next"
* [ ] Configure an alert threshold

Example: have an email sent to you when your bill has reached 80% of your monthly budget.&#x20;

* [ ] Review and "Create budget"

You will now receive an email if your AWS bill is approaching your monthly limit.&#x20;

## Create a new user&#x20;

Instead of continuing to use your root account, let's create a new user and give this user administrator rights. Best practice is to never use the root account for daily tasks.

* [ ] Navigate to IAM and select Users from the panel on the left
* [ ] Click the "Add users" button&#x20;
* [ ] Pick a username
* [ ] Select both access types: programmatic and console access
* [ ] You can choose your own password or have AWS auto-generate one for you

You have successfully created the first user. Next you'll be asked to add the user to a group.&#x20;

ðŸŽ¯ Note: by default users have no permissions at all, so this step is crucial for your user to be able to do anything in AWS.

* [ ] Press "Create group"&#x20;
* [ ] Name your group something descriptive like "Admins" or "Administrators"
* [ ] From the list of policies, select "AdministratorAccess"
* [ ] Press "Create Group"&#x20;

You should now see a group with your chosen name and the AdministratorAccess policy attached (if not, hit refresh).&#x20;

* [ ] Check the box next to the group and click "Next: Tags". You can skip the tag part and go on to "Next: Review".&#x20;
* [ ] Now you can review your choices. After you create the user, you can view and download the autogenerated password (if you chose that option) and access key.

ðŸŽ¯ Note: you can only view the secret access key once, so be sure to either download the credentials for programmatic access or copy them to a secure location.&#x20;

Recommended: enable MFA for this new user as well, following the same instructions as for the root user.&#x20;

## Login URL

On the IAM dashboard, on the right hand side you see a panel that has your

* Account ID (12 digits)
* Account alias (which you can edit)&#x20;
* Sign-in URL for IAM users in this account

ðŸŽ¯ Take note of this sign-in URL (bookmark it) or alternately store your account ID/alias somewhere. These will be needed when you log back in to your account.

## End result&#x20;

Let's log out of the root account and use the sign-in URL from before to log back in as the **regular** user.&#x20;

Your IAM dashboard will look something like this:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (157).png>)

Best practice: use the regular user account from now. You will need root credentials only for billing purposes and maybe to delete your account one day.&#x20;
