# Lambda

## What is Lambda?&#x20;

In AWS' own words,

AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers.&#x20;

With Lambda you can:

* Run code without provisioning or managing infrastructure. Simply write and upload code as a .zip file or container image.
* Automatically respond to code execution requests at any scale, from a dozen events per day to hundreds of thousands per second.
* Save costs by paying only for the compute time you use—by per-millisecond—instead of provisioning infrastructure upfront for peak capacity.

### Agenda

The key features we will look at today are as follows:

* creating a Lambda function via the console and the CLI
* aliases and versioning&#x20;

Let's get started with our first lab!&#x20;
