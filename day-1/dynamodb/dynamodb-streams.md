# DynamoDB Streams

DynamoDB supports streaming of item-level change data capture records in near-real time. You can build applications that consume these streams and take action based on the contents. There are two kinds of streams:

* Kinesis (more about Kinesis on day 5)
* DynamoDB Streams, which we will look at now

DynamoDB Streams captures a time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications in any DynamoDB table and stores this information in a log for up to 24 hours. Applications can access this log and view the data items as they appeared before and after they were modified, in near-real time.

## DynamoDB and Lambda

Amazon DynamoDB is integrated with AWS Lambda so that you can create _triggers_â€”pieces of code that automatically respond to events in DynamoDB Streams. With triggers, you can build applications that react to data modifications in DynamoDB tables.

If you enable DynamoDB Streams on a table, you can associate the stream Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with an AWS Lambda function that you write. Immediately after an item in the table is modified, a new record appears in the table's stream. AWS Lambda polls the stream and invokes your Lambda function synchronously when it detects new stream records.
