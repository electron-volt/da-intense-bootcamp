# Serverless computing

Today we are going to focus on serverless computing. Not only is serverless a cost-effective and modern way of delivering solutions, it's also at the heart of the AWS Developer associate certification.&#x20;

A high-level overview of what we will cover today:

* Lambda or Function as a Service. You provide the code, AWS handle the underlying infrastructure. Code runs in response to triggers.
* DynamoDB, schemaless NoSQL database. Millisecond latency and push-button scalability.&#x20;
* API Gateway for building APIs. Often used as a front for Lambda and DynamoDB.
