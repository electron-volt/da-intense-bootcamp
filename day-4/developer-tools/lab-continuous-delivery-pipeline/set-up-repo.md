# Set up repo

## Fork and clone

Sign in to GitHub. If you do not already use GitHub, you can create a free account. Be sure to also create a personal access token, instructions can be found here: [https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)

Once you have signed in to GitHub:

Go fork this repository: [https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-elastic-beanstalk-express-js-sample](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-elastic-beanstalk-express-js-sample)

Clone the repo you forked with git clone URL. Make sure it's _your_ repo you are cloning - the url should be&#x20;

[https://github.com/YOUR USER NAME NEEDS TO BE HERE/aws-elastic-beanstalk-express-js-sample.git](https://github.com/electron-volt/aws-elastic-beanstalk-express-js-sample.git)

## First commit

On your local machine: make a change in `app.js` on line 5 and then push your changes. Replace 'Hello World!' with any text you want.&#x20;

This text will eventually be shown to the world through Elastic Beanstalk.

Pushing was the usual git add app.js, git commit -m "changed one line", git push.&#x20;

## Trust but verify

Once you've pushed your changes, to check in GitHub that line 5 has indeed changed:

## Where we're at

This is what we have now:
