# Developer tools

This section should be of special importance to us, since the title is after all _Developer_ Associate!&#x20;

We will take a closer look at these services later, but here is a high-level overview of the suite of developer tools AWS offer.&#x20;

![An example of how these tools can be used. ](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (155).png>)

## CodeCommit

Git-based repository. If you're thinking "AWS's version of GitHub or BitBucket", you are not far off the mark.

## CodeBuild

AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service that compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy.

## CodePipeline

AWS CodePipeline is a continuous delivery service you can use to model, visualize, and automate the steps required to release your software.

## CodeDeploy

CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances, serverless Lambda functions, or Amazon ECS services.

## CodeArtifact

CodeArtifact is a fully managed artifact repository service that makes it easy for organizations to securely store and share software packages used for application development. You can use CodeArtifact with popular build tools and package managers such as NuGet, Maven, Gradle, npm, yarn, pip, and twine.

## CodeStar

AWS CodeStar is a cloud-based service for creating, managing, and working with software development projects on AWS. It enables collaboration for teams. New projects can be launched in minutes using templates. We won't cover CodeStar in this course.&#x20;

## Cloud9

AWS Cloud9 is an integrated development environment (IDE) that you can access via a web browser.

It allows you to code, build, run, test, and debug software, and helps you release software to the cloud.

## CloudShell

Basically like AWS CLI, except CloudShell is browser-based.&#x20;

CLI-related: a new feature, auto-prompt for AWS CLI! [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-prompting.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-prompting.html)

Also see aws-shell if you are interested: [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-shell](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-shell)

## Bonus

There is a lab about **CodeGuru** in the bonus section. This is a new service and you can expect it to start showing up in the exam soon.&#x20;
