# Containers

Here is a high-level overview of what our containers section will cover.&#x20;

## Containers 101

_Very_ quick intro to what containers are

## ECS&#x20;

Elastic Container Service. We will build a containerized, load balanced web app using ECS, ECR (Elastic Container Registry) and familiar tools like ALB, Cloud9 and CloudFormation&#x20;

## EKS

Elastic Kubernetes Service. If time permits, then we can take a look at EKS. It doesn't feature very heavily in the Developer Associate exam yet, but Kubernetes is a valuable skill to learn nonetheless.&#x20;

## CI/CD pipeline for ECS

We will combine what we learned today about developer tools as well as ECS. All of these skills come together in the last lab of the day.&#x20;
